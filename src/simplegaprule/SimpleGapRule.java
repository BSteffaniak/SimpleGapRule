/**
 * Simple gap rule implementation.
 * 
 * Gap rule:
 * Most destination resorts don’t host guests who are willing to stay for only one night.
 * Their guests are not simply passing through the area; they’ve often travelled far with
 * lots of luggage specifically to stay there, and it’s not worth it for them to stay one
 * night. As a result, a reservation system for resorts needs to prevent one night gaps in
 * its reservation grid, or schedule of inventory. If one-night gaps occur on the grid,
 * they will not be sold, and this results in lost income for the resort owner. For example,
 * Campspot uses a one-night gap rule, as this is a common problem for camping resort
 * owners. However, owners’ gap problems aren’t limited to one-night gaps. Some resorts
 * only host guests who stay a minimum three or four nights. Those resorts may want to
 * prevent one-, two-, and three-night gaps.
